This folder contains information on a test of AI for creating ttl files to submit new
units to QUDT.
The prompt lists requested new units, specifies the format convention for the DimensionVector, and requests 
a check of the DV and QK for the new units. If they don't exist, the ttl to submit them is requested.
12 units were chosen from the unitWG spreadsheet - these were units that were used often and the WG had identified potential QUDT 
additions for these units.
The full prompt is below.


Claude.ai prompt:
Please create a qudt ttl file for the following units: CentiM3-PER-CentiM2 MicroOHM-PER-CentiM KiloGM-PER-HA-DAY NUM-PER-CentiM3 
MilliGM-PER-GM-DAY MicroMOL-PER-CentiM3 CentiM2-PER-M2 NUM-PER-CentiM2-YR MicroMOL-PER-SEC-M2 NanoGM-PER-GM NUM-PER-CentiM2 MicroMOL-PER-M-SEC2 
Please use this convention for writing the DimensionVector qudt:hasDimensionVector qkdv:A0E0L3I0M0H0T-1D0 ;
  qudt:hasDimensionVector qkdv:A0E0L3I0M0H-1T0D0 ;
Please specify SI conversion. Please check qudt to determine if the DimensionVector already exists and if the QuantityKind already exists. 
If either does not exist, please create a dimensionvector ttl file and quantitykind ttl file as necessary. can you create an output table 
that indicates whether the quantitykind and dimension vector already exist in qudt. and only output the ttl files for those if they do not already exist
