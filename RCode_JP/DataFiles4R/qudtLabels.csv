A difference of 20 decibels corresponds to an increase of 10 x 10 or 100 times in intensity. The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly the aspect of sound being measured. For sound intensity (the power of the sound waves per unit of area) \(0\,decibel\) is equal to \(1\,picoWatts\,per\,Metre\,Squared\). This corresponds approximately to the faintest sound that can be detected by a person who has good hearing.

The term denier is from the French denier, a coin of small value (worth 1/12 of a sou). Applied to yarn, a denier was held to be equal in weight to 1/24 of an ounce.

One farad is defined as the ability to store one coulomb of charge per volt of potential difference between the two conductors. This is a natural definition, but the unit it defines is very large. In practical circuits, capacitance is often measured in microfarads, nanofarads, or sometimes even in picofarads (10-12 farad, or trillionths of a farad).

Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H).

However, due to variations in the rotation rate of the Earth, the rate of an ideal sidereal clock deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock. In practice, the difference is kept track of by the difference UTC-UT1, which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and available to the public at the IERS and at the United States Naval Observatory.

This corresponds to a value of \(6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}\) elementary entities of the substance.

Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object.

The weber is the magnetic flux which, linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second. In SI base units, the dimensions of the weber are \((kg \cdot m^2)/(s^2 \cdot A)\). The weber is commonly expressed in terms of other derived units as the Tesla-square meter (\(T \cdot m^2\)), volt-seconds (\(V \cdot s\)), or joules per ampere (\(J/A\))."

Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronised with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars. Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year, and currently define it as the time required for the mean Sun's tropical longitude (longitudinal position along the ecliptic relative to its position at the vernal equinox) to increase by 360 degrees (that is, to complete one full seasonal circuit).</p>",NA
