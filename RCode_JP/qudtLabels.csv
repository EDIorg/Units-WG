A barn is defined as $10^{-28} m^2 (100 fm^2)$ and is approximately the cross sectional area of a uranium nucleus. The barn is also the unit of area used in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance to quantify the interaction of a nucleus with an electric field gradient.

A difference of 20 decibels corresponds to an increase of 10 x 10 or 100 times in intensity. The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly the aspect of sound being measured. For sound intensity (the power of the sound waves per unit of area) $0\,decibel$ is equal to $1\,picoWatts\,per\,Metre\,Squared$. This corresponds approximately to the faintest sound that can be detected by a person who has good hearing. For sound pressure (the pressure exerted by the sound waves) 0 decibels equals $20\,micropascals\,RMS$, and for sound power $0\,decibels$ sometimes equals $1\,picoWatt$.

The better the insulator, the larger the charge that the conductors can hold. This property of a circuit is called capacitance, and it is measured in farads. One farad is defined as the ability to store one coulomb of charge per volt of potential difference between the two conductors. This is a natural definition, but the unit it defines is very large. In practical circuits, capacitance is often measured in microfarads, nanofarads, or sometimes even in picofarads (10-12 farad, or trillionths of a farad).

The gram was originally defined to be the mass of one cubic centimeter of pure water, but to provide precise standards it was necessary to construct physical objects of specified mass. One gram is now defined to be 1/1000 of the mass of the standard kilogram, a platinum-iridium bar carefully guarded by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris for more than a century.

  The $gauss$, abbreviated as $G$, is the cgs unit of measurement of a magnetic field $B$, 
  which is also known as the ""magnetic flux density"" or the ""magnetic induction"".
  One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter; it equals $10^{-4} tesla$ (or $100 micro T$). 
  The Gauss is identical to maxwells per square centimetre; technically defined in a three-dimensional system, 
  it corresponds in the SI, with its extra base unit the ampere. 
  The gauss is quite small by earthly standards, 1 Gs being only about four times Earth's flux density,

  The unit $\textit{Henry}$ is the SI unit of electric inductance. 
  A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. 
  Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. 
  A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. 
  If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: 
  if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. 
  The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H). 
  The unit is named for the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), one of several scientists who discovered independently how magnetic fields can be used to generate alternating currents. 

  A $\textit{Henry}$ is defined as:

  $$\text{H} \; \equiv \; \text{henry}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{weber}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \frac{\text{V}\cdot\text{s}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{volt} \cdot \text{second}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \Omega\cdot\text{s}\; \equiv\; \text{ohm.second}$$

A mean sidereal day is about 23 h 56 m 4.1 s in length. However, due to variations in the rotation rate of the Earth, the rate of an ideal sidereal clock deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock. In practice, the difference is kept track of by the difference UTC-UT1, which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and available to the public at the IERS and at the United States Naval Observatory. A Sidereal Hour is $1/24^{th}$ of a Sidereal Day. A mean sidereal day is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0916 seconds (23.9344699 hours or 0.99726958 mean solar days), the time it takes Earth to make one rotation relative to the vernal equinox. (Due to nutation, an actual sidereal day is not quite so constant.) The vernal equinox itself precesses slowly westward relative to the fixed stars, completing one revolution in about 26,000 years, so the misnamed sidereal day (""sidereal"" is derived from the Latin sidus meaning ""star"") is 0.0084 seconds shorter than Earth's period of rotation relative to the fixed stars."

A loop of electric current, a bar magnet, an electron, a molecule, and a planet all have magnetic moments. The unit for magnetic moment is not a base unit in the International System of Units (SI) and it can be represented in more than one way. For example, in the current loop definition, the area is measured in square meters and I is measured in amperes, so the magnetic moment is measured in ampere-square meters (A m2). In the equation for torque on a moment, the torque is measured in joules and the magnetic field in tesla, so the moment is measured in Joules per Tesla (J u00b7T-1).

  The unit $\textit{Kelvin}$ is the SI base unit of temperature, previously called the degree Kelvin. 
  One kelvin represents the same temperature difference as one degree Celsius. 
  In 1967 the General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the temperature of the triple point of water
   (the temperature at which water exists simultaneously in the gaseous, liquid, and solid states) to be exactly 273.16 kelvins. 
  Since this temperature is also equal to 0.01 u00b0C, the temperature in kelvins is always equal to 273.15 plus the temperature in degrees Celsius. 
  The kelvin equals exactly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. 
  The unit is named for the British mathematician and physicist William Thomson (1824-1907),
   later known as Lord Kelvin after he was named Baron Kelvin of Largs.

Worldwide, the knot is used in meteorology, and in maritime and air navigation - for example, a vessel travelling at 1 knot along a meridian travels one minute of geographic latitude in one hour.

The area in circular mils, A, of a circle with a diameter of d mils, is given by the formula: Electricians in Canada and the United States are familiar with the circular mil because the National Electrical Code (NEC) uses the circular mil to define wire sizes larger than 0000 AWG. In many NEC publications and uses, large wires may be expressed in thousands of circular mils, which is abbreviated in two different ways: MCM or kcmil. For example, one common wire size used in the NEC has a cross-section of 250,000 circular mils, written as 250 kcmil or 250 MCM, which is the first size larger than 0000 AWG used within the NEC."

  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

  The $\textit{relative permittivity}$ of a material under given conditions reflects the extent to which it concentrates electrostatic lines of flux. 
  In technical terms, it is the ratio of the amount of electrical energy stored in a material by an applied voltage,

  Likewise, it is also the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared to a similar capacitor that has a vacuum as its dielectric. 
  Relative permittivity is a dimensionless number that is in general complex. 
  The imaginary portion of the permittivity corresponds to a phase shift of the polarization $P$ relative to $E$ and leads to the attenuation of electromagnetic waves passing through the medium.

  In chemistry the unit $\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\textit{acidity}$ or $\textit{basicity}$,
   is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of free protons (or hydronium ions).
  The definition of $pH$ in terms of hydrogen ions in solution is:

  $$\text{pH}=-\log_{10}(a_{H^+})\equiv-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)$$

  Where $a_{H^+}$ is the equilibrium molar concentration of $H^+$ in the solution, the activity of
   the hydrogen ion in the solution.
  $$$$
  This definition is appropriate for concentrations equal to, or less than $1\ mol/l$, 
   where $aH+ \equiv [H+]$, that is, $1\ mol/L\ HCl$ has a $pH$ of zero.
  $$$$
  To relate this to standard molality ($b^\circ$), typically taken as $1 \ mol/kg$, 
   consideration is given to the activity ($a_{H^+}$) of the hydrogen ions.
  $$$$
  The activity can be expressed as:

  $$a_{H^+} = \gamma_{H^+} \times m_{H^+}$$ 

  Where, $\gamma_{H^+}$ is the activity coefficient, which adjusts the molality to account for
   non-ideal behavior due to interactions between ions in the solution.
  $m_{H^+}$ is the molality of hydrogen ions in the solution relative to the standard molality, 
   expressed in $mol/kg$.
  $$$$
  The expansion of $pH$ then becomes:

  $$\text{pH} = -log_{10}\left(m_{H+}\times\gamma_{H^+}\right)$$

  $$$$
  This definition is relevant in more concentrated solutions or when precise thermodynamic calculations are required. 
  It reflects how the properties of the solution deviate from ideal behavior and provides a more accurate understanding of the $pH$ under various conditions.
  $$$$
  While $pH$ is a universally recognized scale for expressing hydrogen ion activity,
  its appropriateness and accuracy can diminish under conditions of extremely high
  ionic strength, non-aqueous environments, high temperatures, or very high or low $pH$ values.
  In such cases, alternative measurement strategies might be required to obtain meaningful and accurate descriptions of acidity or basicity.

The most important property of a conductor is the amount of current it will carry when a voltage is applied. 
Current flow is opposed by resistance in all circuits, and by also by reactance and impedance in alternating current circuits. 
Conductance, susceptance, and admittance are the inverses of resistance, reactance, and impedance, respectively. 
To measure these properties, the siemens is the reciprocal of the ohm. In other words, the conductance, susceptance, or admittance, in siemens, is simply 1 divided by the resistance, reactance or impedance, respectively, in ohms. 
The unit is named for the German electrical engineer Werner von Siemens (1816-1892).

""Flux"" is the rate (per unit of time) at which something crosses a surface perpendicular to the flow. The weber is a large unit, equal to $10^{8}$ maxwells, and practical fluxes are usually fractions of one weber. The weber is the magnetic flux which, linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second. In SI base units, the dimensions of the weber are $(kg \cdot m^2)/(s^2 \cdot A)$. The weber is commonly expressed in terms of other derived units as the Tesla-square meter ($T \cdot m^2$), volt-seconds ($V \cdot s$), or joules per ampere ($J/A$)."

Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronised with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars. Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year, and currently define it as the time required for the mean Sun's tropical longitude (longitudinal position along the ecliptic relative to its position at the vernal equinox) to increase by 360 degrees (that is, to complete one full seasonal circuit).</p>",NA
